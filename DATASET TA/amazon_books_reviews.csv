Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).

I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\""PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\""  I never viewed that as being the \\""promised story\\"" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\""lucked out\\"" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\""lucky\\"" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\""jobs\\"" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\""jobs\\"" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.",14/10/2005

But if you have read and enjoyed works such as the first two volumes of \\""Roots of Strategy\\"", you should have no trouble following this book.    The author successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war.  Although he addresses behavior in the midst of battle, the author seems more interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were looking backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated or how they adjusted their feelings afterwards.  I think this \\""flavor\\"" derives from his personal-interview-and-historical-research approach.  I do not see this as a negative but rather staying within his scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titled \\""Flawed work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\"" seems too harshly critical.  Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stating that only \\""some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\""  True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the author never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feeling that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\""skimmed\\"" the book without thinking into what was being presented.      Although now much more interested in peace studies, I enjoyed reading this book.  I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so.

Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.

Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.

One learns, for instance, that the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was completed here. One also learns that, far from being a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Pennsylvania Avenue, the home facilitated Lincoln's open-mindedness about receiving virtual strangers at virtually any hour of the day or night and resulted in serious sleep deprivation.  <br /> <br />However, it was in the other topics addressed in the book that Lincoln's character is at its most illuminating. His fascination with weaponry, his patience in his dealings with his wife, and his ability to establish collegial relationship with people of vastly differing temperaments are all thoughtfully explored...The characters highlighted are dispassionately analyzed in such a way as to enable the reader to be part of the scene at all times.  For instance, Lincoln's wife, so often pilloried...is given a fair hearing and is properly depicted as a courageous soul confronted by agonizing choices and exaggerated expectations of the First Lady's performance as a suitable consort of the most admired President in American History...Mrs. Brownstein provides a valuable service for readers interested in the less dramatic, but no less insightful, clues about Lincoln the President, confronted, as he was, by the unprecedented challenges associated with his era. <br />",14/10/2005

A novel about an UNDERachieving university might be interesting as well, but I think the scope of I Am Charlotte Simmons, and Dupont in particular, was well suited to Wolfe's acute powers of observation.",14/10/2005

The reasons are manifest.  Villainous Lens Larque provides some of the best challenges and intimidation for our hero, Kirth Gersen.  There's the usual helping of exquisite writing and fine descriptions; the menu items during Gersen's restraunt visits are particularly noteworthy.  Most importantly, \\""The Face\\"" is the most morally challenging novel in the series.  It presents, to some extent, the best argument for Gersen abandoning his single-minded hunt for revenge in his abortive attempts at romance with two characters.  Lastly, \\""The Face\\"" has a killer ending, laugh-out-loud serious if there ever was such a thing. <br /> <br />Another notable element is the planet Dar Sai and its inhabitants, the Darsh.  Dar Sai is odd even by Vance standards.  Giant umbrellas of water protect folks from searing daytime heat, the women grow mustaches, food is prized for its repulsiveness and gender wars are taken to a whole new level.  Vance scores particular points by showing us the spoiled tourists who visit solely to mock the backwards Darsh.  An just dessert is served for them at the end, of course. <br /> <br />The last novel in the series, \\""The Book of Dreams\\"", is competent but less biting than \\""The Face\\"".  The new villain, Howard Alan Treesong, is less impressively hateable than Lens Larque or Viole Falshune from \\""The Palace of Love\\"".  \\""The Book of Dreams\\"" contains vignettes set on numerous planets, none of them particuarly brilliant.

As someone who enjoys mysteries, as well as historical fiction and gothic novels of suspense, I was quite taken with this book. Intricately plotted, the book is clever in its premise. Two disparate human beings, a highly independent, red-headed slip of a woman, Samantha Flood, Australian by birth, and a serious, fervently religious Spaniard, Miguel Madero, who is half-English, find themselves thrust together, as each explores the tiny, remote Cumbrian village of Illthwaite in England, looking for answers to their individual quests.  Both are in Illthwaite to get information relative to that which each is seeking. Both are staying in the local inn, called The Stranger House.<br /><br />Samantha is a brilliant but brash mathematician in her early twenties. Fondly known as Sam to her friends, she is interested in tracing her familial roots. She has recently discovered that her paternal grandmother was from this part of the world,  having been a part of a huge number of children migrants that had been unceremoniously shipped from England to other parts of its Empire, including Australia. Samantha is interested in finding out more about her paternal grandmother and the mystery surrounding her.<br /><br />Miguel, or Mig, as he is known to his family and friends, is the scion of a well-known house of vintners in Spain and is in his late twenties. He is a former seminarian who has suffered from manifestations of what he believes to be stigmata. He also, on occasion, sees ghostly manifestations or visions. Recovering from a serious alpine accident that nearly killed him, he is now in Illthwaite ostensibly to do research  for his thesis on the experience of English Catholics during the Reformation. He is, however, actually in Illthwaite to find out more about an ancestor of his who mysteriously disappeared there centuries ago during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />In Illthwaite, Both Sam and Mig find themselves up against obstacles placed in their way. It seems that its residents are not totally forthcoming or are reluctant to part with information relative to their respective quests. What they each individually discover is that things are not always as they seem in Illthwaite.  Moreover, their divergent interests are more intertwined than they could ever have imagined. They will discover that they have more in common than they realized, having come full circle in a cosmic design not of their making.<br /><br />This book has well-drawn characters that come alive under the author's expert hand. The plot is unusual, as well as complex, containing many layers that the discerning reader will enjoy exploring. Well-written, as well as intricately plotted, this book crosses a number of genres. With its supernatural portents, historical underpinnings, underlying mystery, as well as its gothic type  suspense and sensibilities, infused with just a dollop of  romance, this book will appeal to those readers who favor these genres. In particular, I found the parts of the book that transcended into historical fiction to be the most compelling.

It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours!

We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.

When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\""what happened\\"" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\""feel\\"" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\""hear\\"" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\""what just happened\\""?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.

The Aztec empire stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic costs of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom was found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America.  But this book considers the people of these regions to be a mosaic of tribes and nations so that most of the chapters are topical, talking about food and drink, religious life, masks, and such in terms of all of the cultures that apply.  There are a few specific chapters devoted to the Incas and their ancestors and Cities of the Andes, but most toss in everything together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find this approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean cultures that lumps Spain, Italy and Greece together with the likes of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In this volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltecs are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anything close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topics where it makes sense to talk about multiple cultures, such as the Human sacrifice by the Incas and Aztecs, but that does not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempted to get different colored highlighters and color code the three main cultures throughout the book so it is easier to make the connections.<br /><br />As always, the chief attraction of this Eyewitness Book is that it is filled with photographs of artifacts from museums around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasures made their way to Europe).

He then goes into their relationship, how it came to be, and the affect it had on their great works of literature. The books influenced by their time together, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Grant's Personal Memoirs, are considered to be classics and the best that either of the authors ever produced.  In fact, some think that Huckleberry Finn is the best American novel ever, and that Personal Memoirs (about the Mexican and Civil Wars) is the best American book ever written on military events.   Perry records many conversations Grant and Twain had with each other and with the other folks surrounding them, including families and associates.  It makes you feel like you are there, and gives some personal insight into what these gentlemen were really like. We find that they were both quite remarkable as private figures as well as public figures. The story of their relationship rides to a great extent on the heroic drama of Grant racing to finish his book before dying of cancer, to ensure the financial security of his family.  Perry, at the same time, paints a fascinating sketch of what Twain called the Gilded Age, a time of great industrial progress along with great corruption in the U.S. <br /> <br />It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. <br />",14/10/2005

In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\""Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\"". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\""Power vs. Force\\"", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\""The Eye of the I\\"" and \\""I\\"" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\""Truth vs Falsehood\\"" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\""Truth vs Falsehood\\"", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\""wakes up\\"" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\""All warfare is based on deception.\\"" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico",14/10/2005

There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\""adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\"") and acculturation (\\""adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\""). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\""Develop cultural competency\\"" and \\""Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\"" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\""one model fits all.\\"" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\""win/win,\\"" \\""both/and,\\"" \\""alignment,\\"" and \\""interdependence\\"" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\""baby with the bath water\\"" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\""Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\""  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />",14/10/2005

I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life.

I did not like the idea that instead of Tarl Cabot we were now telling the story of a different Earth man who ends up on Gor, although the Jason Marshall trilogy was more interesting to me than the story of Judy Thornton, a woman brought to Gor as a captive in \\""Slave Girl of Gor.\\""  In the first volume of the trilogy, \\""Fighting Slave of Gor,\\"" Marshall ends up on Gor when he tries to save Beverly Henderson from a Gorean slave trap.  The next thing the civilized Earth man knows he is a slave on Gor.  Starting out as the silk slave of the Lady Florence of Vonda, Marshall then becomes a Gorean gladiator, which gives him the opportunity to become free so that he can find Beverly, who now also a slave on Gor.<br /><br />\\""Rogue of Gor\\"" is the middle volume in the trilogy and the novel and has Marshall searching for Beverly.  But since this is a trilogy you know that he is not going to find her until the final volume, \\""Guardsman of Gor.\\""  Instead, Marshall travels along the River Vosk to the port city of Victoria, north of Port Kar, and finds himself in the middle of a war between Glorious Ar and the Salerian Confederation as the pirate fleet seeks to control the waterways of Gor on which the cities are so dependent.  In terms of providing more action than sex, this is the one volume of the trilogy that delivers on that score and if you are waiting for Jason and Beverly to consummate their relationship in Gorean terms you have the last half of the next novel for all of that to play out (after a giant naval battle).  In this one he finds her on the slaver's block, buys her, and sets her free even though she insists she is a true slave and therefore does not desire freedom.<br /><br />There is a sense in which Norman is trying to get back to the basics, since the fight between Ar and the Salerian Confederation is not, at face value, part of the gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.  But the sexual philosophy of Gor is now becoming the dominant theme of Norman's stories.  The back of the original paperback declares, \\""Jason Marshall learned the meaning of manhood and the power of women, both dominant and submissive\\"" on Gor, but clearly he has yet to fully accept his role in this society.

Clearly Norman is arguing men have to be carefully taught such beliefs almost as much as women, although you will never convince me the male of the species would require as much persuasion.  Consequently, whether you judge \\""Rogue of Gor\\"" by the standard of either the best Gor adventures (\\""Nomads of Gor\\"" and \\""Assassins of Gor\\"") or the main testaments of Gorean sexuality (\\""Slave Girl of Gor,\\"" \\""Kajira of Gor,\\"" and \\""Dancing Girl of Gor\\""), it falls short.

I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\""fiddled while Rome burned\\"" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\""persecution\\"" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\""apologist\\"" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\""live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\"" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\""afterlife\\"" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\""Final Judgments,\\"" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquoting of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadowing of the paraphrasing to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explaining the links between money and reporting and providing a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\""politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\"" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demanding a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tuning to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becoming customer-driven reinforcing agents. If that's true, why is the media making that choice instead of taking the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giving hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\""I don't vote....\\"" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\""I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\"" After 116 pages of caterwalling about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\""message,\\"" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\""do as I say, not as I do.\\"" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attacking the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choosing that one gains perspective and insight. Not voting because you're a journalist is like saying a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or deciding not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.

However, one can assume that many of Rowling's younger readers have followed the books from the beginning, and grown as Harry Potter did. For the younger readers just starting, however, along about book four some of the material may be a tad startling or disconcerting.    In any case, I have found the writing to be thoroughly entertaining, particularly the effective use of tongue-in-cheek humor. There is a comical brattiness about many of the characters (professors, parents, and students alike) which plays pretty well. The childishness of the main characters can be a bit trying at times, I will admit; but it is forgivable and understandable...they are, after all, still kids.    The use of suggestion and mystery -- of questions that do not get answered till the end of the book -- can also be a bit trying at times, but it is also compelling and intriguing at the same time, and part of this author's trademark.    All in all, these are exciting, fast-paced books, truly classics in their own time, and I am duly impressed that they lived up to their hype in my mind, skeptic that I was. Five stars, for cripe's sake.",14/10/2005

It's a beautiful love story that had me up all night reading, I finished it in one day. A true page turner, comedy and tear jerker. A real quick read. Buy It!",14/10/2005

This one is as good as all the others. Somehow she makes all her books feel \\""new\\"" even though they have the same theme. They never get boring or tedious. Being a European myself, I like the way a lot of her plots revolve around European cities and countries. She aparently knows a lot about the places she write, and also a lot about antiquites and history. I am looking forward to her writing about Sweden some day. If you like her other books, this is a sure bet! I hope she will continue writing for many many years to come.",14/10/2005
