0,6.5,Great Lakes Conway's Irish Ale,Irish Red Ale,3,2.5,2,2,A Very average nothing special. Pours to a light red color with a nice 2 finger head. Laces nicely around the glass S Very bread like to me with a hint of hops and yeast. I also pick up a slight spice aroma T This isn't very good : ( The more I drink it the less I like it. Very metalic finish to the beer. In my opinion not a good thing. I have it rated at a 2 but I wouldn't be affraid to go lower. I'm in a nice mood tonight. M Well carbinated but it leaves a foul coating on my mouth. O I will never drink another one of these! I'm almost ready to proclaim this thing as awful. Great Lakes is a hit or miss for me and this is clearly a miss. I would say the Cleveland Browns are better than this beer.,0
1,5,Tuborg Premium Lager (Gold / Guld),Euro Pale Lager,3,2,2,2.5,"Better than some macros, but not that good at all. This one poured a typical clear golden color but had a nice white head that stuck around and left a bunch of lace om my glass. The smell was of overly sweet maltiness and not much else. The taste was not too impressive with nothing more than some astringent sweetness and some fuel type flavors. Not recommended at all.",0
2,10,Swamp Ape IPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4,3.5,3,1.5,"Bottle from a trade, poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a dark copper, but very clear. Barely half a finger of white bubbly head that quickly dissipated to a small and thin collar along the edge of the glass. The collar leaves some light lacing as you take sips. Decent amount of carbonation visible floating up slowly from the bottom of the glass. Nose is sweet caramelized orange peel, and a bit of cognac like booziness. Not too much hops aroma detected, which isn't too good for a DIPA. Wow, very very boozy, that it burns the tongue as soon as it hits. Very sweet on the tongue as well, caramel malt very apparent. Just a faint citrus peel flavor hidden under all the booze and sweetness. Really lacking in bitterness, though I did sit on this for a month after receiving it in a trade. However, I can't imagine it being stored at low temperatures for a month would degrade all bitter notes. Medium body with decent carbonation to prevent it from being syrupy. However, it's just not a very good DIPA, not enough hops, too much booze, and too sweet.",0
3,5.5,Scratch Beer 36 - Bruce Wit,Witbier,3.5,4,4,4,"It was the scratch beer festival night! i had spent a good deal of time collecting these and finally tracked down the last of what i needed and put them all down in a massive tasting. Split with my brother in law and his buddy on 5/6, these were all split into 6 ounce samplers. special note, this was the hardest to acquire of all of them! A decent pour here, though not much in the way of any head on it so to speak. Still nice hazy and cloudy medium amber colored beer had some nice carbonation to it and a well rounded look. The aroma was nice, hints of banana, cloves, and an almost bubble gum like aroma peeking in through the mammoth wheat smell. Same held true for the flavor, with massive amounts of wheat present right away that melded themselves into a nice banana and clove profile that seemed to continue to develop as it continued to warm. Nice balance here with a light to medium body and smooth carbonation, left with a slightly dry flavor in the mouth, I went in for a few more sips leaving a nice bubble gum flavor throughout.",2
4,6,Chocolate Stout,American Stout,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Very good looking, very tasty, and very sweet-smelling. All around a fun beer...there's just one problem. There's too much of it. Other reviewers have noticed it's pronounced chocolate aroma and loads of chocolate flavor, as well as the sharp appearance and textbook stout mouthfeel, and they do not lie. But 22 oz. is overkill. Imagine eating an entire box of truffles, and that's about what it's like to drink a bomber of this stuff. It's the nectar of the gods for the first 10-15 minutes. After that, however, you learn that you truly can have too much of a good thing. Unless you really love chocolate and just can't get enough, I recommend something smaller than the big bottle. Seven oz. bottles are available. Better yet, get a big one and split it with a special lady. No sane woman would turn down chocolate.",0
5,9,Stoudt's Triple (Belgian Abbey-Style Ale),Tripel,3.5,1.5,3,1.5,"Bubbly copper with a rich white head. Looks nice in my Hoegaarden Grand Cru glass. Smells like spicy belgian yeast and leather. Slightly of the plastic that insulates wires. Reminds me of homebrew in a bad way. Very sweet, with a hint of biscuit or shortbread. Warms my chest as it moves past my heart. Its almost under-attenuated kind of sweet, but a hop bitterness comes from nowhere to rescue it at the very last second. Not bad, but not good either. Has a nice sharp triple mouthfeel. Everything you would expect from the style; Slightly full with lots of CO2. I think the CO2 is actually what, in conjuction with the hop bitterness, saves this beer from being cloying. I really don't think I'd want to drink another. I just cannot recommend this beer. It falls short in every important category. I have found it especially difficult to get past my nose. EDIT: Now that some of the CO2 has faded, it IS cloying. This triple has moved from ""not bad"" to bad in a hurry. Looks like a dumper. If you are going to try this beer drink it quickly.",0
6,5.3,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4,2,4,2,"I am not the descriptive type by far, But I have tried quite a few of the samuel adams beers, And I can say I really dont feel like I am even drinking a beer when I had one of these, Chick drink comes to mind. My wife really liked it though, And turns out the neigbhor's wife likes it as well. Yet he pretty much thought the same about it.",0
7,4.9,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,Vienna Lager,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured into the glass a light amber color that had red/orange highlights to it, it was very clear and well carbonated. The beer produced a decent head, white in color and semi lasting in nature. It was fluffy and sticky which was evident in the lace that it left behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, caramel, flowers, hops and a hint of citrus. The flavors were exactly the same, sweet malt, caramel, hops, citrus (light) and flowers. It left a semi hop finish that was light and semi dry. An all around smooth and quaffable beer, it is very easy to drink. A good staple to have around because of its balanced flavors, aromas and drink ability. A must for all those who want to step into the craft world.",2
8,9,Kapittel Prior,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Vintage 2006 bottle poured into my Duvel tulip. A-Opens with a whoosh of carbonation and some gun smoke. Pours an attractive mahogany with an inch of khaki head. Light soapy lacing. S-Fruity, slightly tart cherry acidity, caramel maltiness. T/M-Age has thinned this beer out considerably, but that's not a bad thing. The carbonation, so intense when I first cracked the bottle, has receded and is now very light. Just the right amount to separate the flavors and hold the beer together. The requisite flavors of plum and prune are present, with some light baking spices on the back end. There is just a touch of light acidity. Possibly the beginning stages of oxidization, but it's actually kind of nice. D- I found a few of these buried in the back room of my beer store, so I will be drinking this until it's gone!",2
9,4.8,Sierra Nevada Kellerweis Hefeweizen,Hefeweizen,4,3.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle at The Dish in Ormond Beach, FL. Served in a flute glass more suitable for a witbier than a hefeweizen. Review from notes taken shortly after tasting. A: hazy orange with golden yellow hues and a thick cap of frothy, cream white head. S & T: ripe banana, clove, bubble gum, nutmeg, wheat malt, and a floral, citrus hop spice to end. The flavour is more robust than you'd expect for a 4.8% beer, and I can see why this is so highly rated. M: soft, crisp, spicy and thirst quenching. Straightforward but spot on for the style. D: certainly something you could drink continuously on a summer afternoon, and the ABV accommodates sessioning. Another great beer from Sierra Nevada. I have yet to try a bad or mediocre offering from their lineup.",2
10,17.5,Samuel Adams Triple Bock,American Strong Ale,1,1,1.5,1.5,"I thought that I might be in for a Pleasant surprise with this beer. I thought it couldn't be as bad as people said it was, boy was I wrong. Got this from jtingue and split it with Dannenberg. Pours completely still and soy sauce hits me in the face. I have never experienced this in a beer, I didn't think it was possible for beer to smell like this, but it does. Soy sauce and sickly sweet toffee and maybe, but in the worst way possible. I was really thinking of just stopping there, but for the same reason that I watched the entirety of ""the room"" I forge on. It was difficult to actually take a sip of this but when I did i was rewarded with more soy and sweet and a mild sour of beer gone bad over a decade and a half. Medicinal and soysauce. What the fuck was I thinking. Mouthfeel was sticky so it stays with you. I will say though that the aftertaste wasn't horrible. Coffe caramel kind if sweet, but still not that great. And it won't leave. This is truly foul and lives up to it's billing as the worst thing I have ever drank on purpose.",0
11,10,Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,2,1,1.5,1,"'Vintage' bottle from 2003. Aged by B. United, not me. Yay autolysis and oxidation!! After making a mess of the counter and myself trying to get the cork out, I poured a bit of this oily-looking stuff into a snifter. Completely opaque and really, about the consistency of 10w 50. About the same head, too. It doesn't look incredibly appetizing, but it's pretty hard to pass judgment on a beer for its appearance. Where this stuff can be faulted is, well, everywhere else. It smells god-awful. Not just awful, which apparently awards it a '1.0' here on BA, but god-awful. Where's the .5? 0? In any case, the wave of soy sauce is the first thing that hits the poor little smell-receptors. They're in for a beating. This stuff really reeks. It's beyond oxidized. There should be new terminology for this. The odor is so off-putting I could barely keep my nose in the glass long enough to smell the comparatively dainty roasted malt. As I guessed, letting this stuff loose on my tongue was none-too-pleasant. Revolting is fitting. What a ridiculous, oxidized mess. There's still a stout there somewhere, but it's awfully hard to find. Kikkoman beware, this stuff might beat you out in a blind tasting over vegetable fried rice. Maybe they could make it into a spread and sell it to those people that somehow enjoy choking down vegemite. I haven't reviewed anything in ages--it seems like a pointless exercise, normally--but I had to express just how incredibly bad this stuff is. If I had actually bought this bottle, I would rage. This is why beer should not be put down in a cellar. Even by professionals. I've had a lot of beer, but this *might* be the worst ever.",0
12,7,XS McRogue Scotch Ale,Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,4,4,4,4,"On tap at the Alibi Room in Vancouver. A: 1/4"" white head over copper liquid with good clarity. S: Some citrus hops and some yeast. T: Citrus and pine hops up front which transitions to an finish with a relatively heavy presence of alcohol. M: Medium viscosity and a medium level of fine carbonation. Some drying from the alcohol. O: A drinkable Scotch Ale whose taste is affected by the presence of alcohol.",2
13,7.5,Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout,American Double / Imperial Stout,4,4,1,2,"beerbarons.wordpress.com Label: Japanese Dark Ale brewed with Coffee Beans Kounosu Naka-Shi Ibark, Japan Kiuchi Brewery www.kodawari.cc ABV: 7.5% Appearance: Head: Dark khaki, fluffy, long lasting Body: Roasted, hoppy, coffee, chocolate Taste: Burnt, roasted, strong coffee flavor, light body for a stout, hoppy bitter bite, coffee aftertaste, hints of chocolate, hint of cream. Stu's Review: I really wanted to enjoy this beer. I mean the only Japanese Beer I've had is Sapporo so I wanted to see how the micro brewing differs in our brothers to the west (in The US its to the west). This beer was missing something vital. It's consistency and taste was akin to that last cup of coffee in the morning batch...you know the kind, its kinda cold, and a little thicker than it should be. It's got a bitter bite, but the light body is where I think this beer went wrong. When I have a stout I want body, I want a creamy meal in a glass, not some puny coffee black water...I am not sure whats going on either because if you look at beeradvocate they rank this beer an A-...well now you know why we don't rank. Before I go on a rant about rankings let me finish this review. The flavor/light body combo doesn't work. Its got a hint of cream...hint...not enough to change my mind. Try one, maybe I'm crazy (as people will tell you I am), see what you think. I find that stouts are very hit or miss with me. In comparison to its competitor, Lagunitas Cappuccino Stout, it falls flat on its crazy japanese label. Where I got it 2001 18th St NW Washington, DC 20009 (202) 986-5002 Get directions $5.00---&gt; not worth the price.",0
14,7.5,Payback Porter,American Porter,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Thanks to dgb3 for this extra. Poured into my custom etched dead man's hand pint glass. Very dark in color. I would say dark brown and not black. A bit of light gets through at the edges. Huge cocoa colored head that started out at about three fingers. Very frothy and sticky. Lace is sticky as well, for now. The smell is fantastic Deep rich, roasted malts that come as chocolate covered coffee beans. A bit of tart. Almost the nose of a well crafted stout, but not quite. The taste is about like the smell. Dark roasted flavors, coffee beans, just a hint of chocolate and defiantly tart taste. A lot more Porter here that the smell gave off. Kind of like a light Stout (okay that is kinda what a Porter is). The mouth is a bit dry and hollow but I can't complain for it being a Porter and not as the nose led me, a Stout. It is why the style, in my opinion is a stepping stone to the Stouts that so many of us love. Over all I enjoyed this extra from dgb3. The appearance and smell was the best part of this but I can't complain about any of this one. Recommended!!",2
15,10,AleSmith Grand Cru Ale,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Strawberry caramel with bright orange edges. The cap is pale orangish ecru in color and is airily expansive thanks to a near Belgianesque amount of carbonation. It's too bad that it doesn't share the firm, sticky texture of the best Belgian heads though. The foam is much too soft to last or to result in much glass coverage. The beer itself looks great though. On a good note, the nose is classic BSDA. On a not so good note, it could be both more powerful and more complex. It's wonderfully mushy apple fruity with a warm spiciness that is more appealing the more I smell it. I detect cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, spices that remind me of autumn for some reason. Warming improves things to a considerable extent and makes a bump in score an easy call. I needn't have worried. This brewery rarely disappoints and they definitely haven't done so here. One sweet, spicy, explosive sip is all it takes to tell me that Grand Cru is yet another fantastic AleSmith ale. For some reason, it looks as though the brewery decided to stop putting the vintage on the bottle. My best guess is that I'm drinking the 2005 edition. This truly is a world-class BSDA that can easily hold its head high in the company of the best that Belgium has to offer. Grand Cru isn't all that dark in terms of roasted malt (see Stone Vertical Epic 05.05.05), but is more darkly fruit along the lines of heavily spiced dates and figs. Delicious, delicious, delicious. I'm a little surprised at how sweet it is. That isn't a complaint though, I love sweet as long as it's in the context of an outstanding, multi-faceted flavor profile, as it is here. It looks like a perfect amount of dark candi sugar is Grand Cru's secret weapon. That and a wonderfully spicy Trappist yeast strain that provides authenticity and complexity galore. I'm feeling the double-digit ABV much more than I'm tasting it. Well-integrated alcohol is a valued part of the flavor, as it is in almost all big beer. The fact that it whispers rathers than shouts is a very dangerous thing indeed. The body/mouthfeel is the best of both worlds. It's full, borderline syrupy and sticky, yet is as energetically carbonated as all but the most hyperactive Belgians. Grand Cru is truly wonderful beer. It pays homage to its Continental counterparts while at the same time delivering a distinctly American, big beer twist. It isn't often that I spend $13 on one bottle, but it's hard to argue with the quality that this brewery puts into each and every one of their 750s. I love AleSmith beer!",2
16,6.8,Just Outstanding IPA,American IPA,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Ken's bottle from Portland, thanks for sharing! Outstanding hoppy aromas, getting Cascade. Cloudy grapefruit colour with outstanding 2 inch head that lasts and leads to lots of lace. Average mouthfeel. Outstanding balance and drinkability. Orange and grapefuit with a little tangerine.",2
17,6.2,Hoss,MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Appearance: A crystal-clear copper-colored body capped by two fingers of creamy off-white head that feature good retention and lacing. Aroma: A brown sugar-like, toasty, and earthy malt body with and a splash of rye. Nothing as far as hops are concerned, but I'm not really missing them. Flavor: Again, the focus here the malt; it's biscuity, bready, a little spicy, earthy, and has that tasty little dash of rye. Spicy hops show up towards the finish, but this is very much a malt-forward beer. Lots of sweet, earthy malt in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Drinkability: This is an easy drinker for anyone not afraid of a little malt. Verdict: Hoss is a great little beer. Easy drinking and full of character, I could easily mistake this for an authentic German brew. Good to see a tasty Mrzen that's available outside of fall.",2
18,6.8,Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale,American IPA,3,3,1.5,2,"Although not even exceptionally hoppy I think this beers is still too bitter, too dry. Especially in the finish it developes a harsh bitterness, almost medicinal. Leaving a very dry mouthfeel like you've been sucking on a piece of rusty metal. I shared the bottle with a friend and I'm glad I did because I probably couldn't have finished it on my own. Smells ok though, fruity and flowers, like most American IPA's.",0
19,8.8,Lion Imperial Premium Malt Pilsner,Euro Strong Lager,2.5,1,1,1,"Yuck! Picked this up by mistake, as I meant to grab their fairly decent stout. This is not in the same ballpark. Pours golden with a thick head that very quickly fades to nearly nothing. Smells like rubbing alcohol with some very late graininess. Nothing like a nice whiff of solvent to wake your appetite up for the beer that follows. Tastes similar, which is -bad. Makes my eyes water from what seems to be a shot of cheap vodka more than it is a beer. Not even any hint of the grain this time (not that really helped the aroma). Mouthfeel is harsh and chemical feeling, and to me this whole beer is undrinkable. Drain pour.",0
20,6.2,Lips Of Faith - Biere De Mars,BiÃ¨re de Garde,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Fat tire fermented with lemon. Well, that's a first impression to my untamed taste buds. Upon further reflection there is more going on here. And even without that reflection, fat tire fermented with lemons really isn't so bad. A session brew that you would grow tired of after a couple months, convienently enough it is only available for such. Pours a nice copper color, off white head. Biscuity aromas, lemony slightly puckering taste.",2
21,5.5,Brewer Patriot Collection - 1790 Root Beer Brew,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3,4,3,2.5,"Pours a hazed rust hued body, topped by a small, offwhite head that quickly falls away. Aroma is pungent with herbs, mostly sassafras. I really enjoy the aroma of this. Quite fragrant! Anise, clove, and wintergreen compliment the sassafras. Mouthfeel is ight bodied, with medium carbonation. Taste echoes the nose, with sassafras, wintergreen, and clove, joined by a honey and molasses sweetness that quickly grows cloying. A very interesting brew, but not one I can handle. Simply too sweet, and the herbal essence is too overbearing.",0
22,6.5,Aphrodisiaque,American Stout,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer was a total surprise for me as I was not expecting much. I poured it into a snifter and it poured an opaque brown with little head. The smell was of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and just a hint of vanilla. The taste was very simillar to the smell. Even though I was expecting a little heavier mouthfeel, it was still fine and very drinkable. Overall I was very pleased with this beer and will be looking to purchase more of it!",2
23,6,Chatoe Rogue First Growth Creek Ale,Dubbel,3,4,2,2,I really wanted to like this beer. The beer was served chilled in wide mouth goblet. Appearance: The body of the beer is a murky mahogany coloration. The head is a thin white coloration that rapidly resolves. Smell: I had high hopes based on the aroma. Sweet tart and sour cherries great my nose. A pleasant musty clove aroma lurks in the background. Taste: Taste is a major let down. Musty tart cherries and little else. In short this beer is bland! No off flavors just nothing really going on. Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light. Light carbonation really seems to make the beer go a bit more limp. Drinking the beer was a chore and after about 3/4 of a glass I became too bored to finish.,0
24,5.35,LongShot Grape Pale Ale,Fruit / Vegetable Beer,4,4,3,3.5,"First, Thanks to Swigger for this great Sam Adams Longshot beer. Look: Poured a honey brown color with a half-finger white head that quickly recedes into a fine lace and oilslick of bubbles on the surface. Up to the light it has a mellow gold lining to it. Nose: Very mild grape scent and some malt. Mouthfeel: I will agree with some of the other reviewers that it seems a little overcarbonated. Drinkability: Pretty good, Pale Ales and IPAs have never really been my thing, but I'm finally coming around to them. I could have a few of these without a problem. Good summer beer. Overall this is one of the most pleasant fruit based beers I've had. It's subtle and doesn't scream of the fruit that it was brewed with. Nicely done, and well worth the Longshot namesake.",2
25,8.7,Unplugged Imperial Saison,Saison / Farmhouse Ale,4.5,5,4,4,"Appearance - Light orangish-amber. Quite cloudy. Thick white head that's very persistent. Smell - Fruit is the primary aroma - orange, vague citrus. Also some floral hops, a little vague spiciness. Fresh smelling. Taste - Fruit is present almost immediately. Sour orange or even lemon is the principal flavor. Malt, alcohol, and a little peppery spice present, but overshadowed by the fruit. Finishes quite dry. Not a huge fan of the style, but this appears to be a very good example. Mouthfeel - Light to moderate. Drinkability - Nice beer to sample in the summer. It has a freshness for the heat, but also a complexity for the drinker. Not a style I seek out, but well worth the try.",2
26,6,Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,American IPA,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a nice amber color with a fluffy white head into my glass. Looks really good for the style. Aroma is grassy, floral and even has a bit of citrus to boot. No doubt about it,t he hops are the stars here. Taste is full of rich, buttery malt followed by a good hint of grassy hops with just a touch of mint and citrus. Really lights up the mouth with flavor. Mouthfeel is full of lingering hop bitterness but it's not strong at the back. Finishes almost clean except for a slight hint of carbonation. Coats the throat on the way down. Impressive and highly drinkable. I remember when people used to wish that Sam Adams would make IPAs and now that they have, it's quite solid. Wish it was in 6 packs though but well worth the purchase of a 12 pack to get 5 other great styles.",2
27,6.5,Founders Porter,American Porter,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I'm not the biggest porter fan but this one is very good! It poured a dark magenta/brownish. The smell was almost all like a sweet coffee, and brown sugar? The taste was fabulous! I loved the coffee I got out of it finished by a sweet brown sugar, way back on the tongue. I could drink a bunch of thesewithout getting bored of them I'd try this if you could get your hand son it!",2
28,7.2,Sinebrychoff Porter,Baltic Porter,5,4.5,4,4.5,"33 cL bottle with no freshness date, despite the fact that the label says ""best before"" in three languages. It pours as black as a dank imperial stout and has a finger of orangey/brown head. Almost dares you to drink it. Smells of chocolate, coffee, cocoa, roasty malts, currants, blackberries, and otherwise sweet malts. It has a big roasty/burnt flavor with dark berries and lots of IBUs from the green hops and the roasty/coffee malts. In addition, theres sweet and smoky malts, charcoal, tobacco juice, some acidity, old leather, and maybe some piney spice. The body is medium and a bit drying, a little numbing, and leaves a looong roasty/coffee finish. Overall quite nice - would go great with barbecue. However, it's probably better with age as the IBUs are still a bit too prevalent.",2
29,10.9,Barleywine Style Ale,American Barleywine,4,3.5,4,4,"A 650 mL capped bottle purchased somewhere (Well's or Capone's or State Line). A: The barleywine is a thick, amber-red color, so dark that it appears a chocolatey brown. The head has consistently poured near 2 fingers and leaves a nice trail in the glass. S: The nose is full of concentrated malts and a great deal of hops. The malt body is very strong, to the point that it takes on a unique sweetness. T: This barleywine really strikes a cord. It starts off with a big malt body, thick with grains and dry green grapes and raisins. The flavors are complex and quite deep, showing off some alefruits and a dry medicinal (tylenol-like) finish. Layered on top of the malts are a great deal of bitter, huge hops. They add a citrusy bite that cuts through the thick malts and leave a lasting finish in the back of the mouth. M: Big hops and strong malts, a very dangerous combination. But also very delicious. D: The abv is huge, limiting the number of times that you can go to the well with this one. It's a good, big mouthfeel though and easily one of Green Flash's better offerings.",2
30,4.7,Barons Extra Special Bitter,Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a cloudy amber with a finger of lingering head. Not much smell, though a slight spice, clove? Light baking spice on the first sip... good balance of bitter with maltiness. Light flavor of vanilla and apple on the palate. Good mouthfeel, fairly smooth with light carbonation. Overall a decent beer and drinkable. Fairly complex for an ESB.",2
31,4.8,Key West Sunset Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,4,2,3,1.5,"The beer presents nicely enough, with a lovely copper color and appropriate carbonation. The head dissipates rather quickly without much lace. The nose doesn't offer much--a slight hint of citrusy hops, and a tiny suggestion of biscuit and malt. Upon first drinking it, you expect quite a bit more than what is delivered. The extremely thin primary beer taste is a minuscule toastiness and scratch of hops in the finish. However, the primary overall taste might be compared more closely to seltzer water or club soda, with a more beer-like mouthfeel. Weird. It's disappointing when a beer initially looks this nice, and then lets you down. I should also say that I've had this beer on draught at the brewery tap room, and it was considerably better, but still not great. I might be willing to accept that I got a bad 6-pack, and that the bottle version could be better, but even at the source it was marginal. Maybe in the heat of the Florida summer, in the brewery with the pasteurizer running on high, an ice cold, super-light beer like this is just what they're looking for.",0
32,7,Smooth Hoperator,Doppelbock,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass. Pours an amber-red, with a frothy off-white head and plenty of carbonation. Has a hoppy-pin aroma, with loads of sweet malt and hints of citrus. Sweet and fruity start, with a yeasty malty middle and mildly bitter sweet end. Grapes, peaches and apricots are present, with a bit of spice at the finish. Medium-bodied, this is a smooth drinking beer. Fairly drinkable, while it has a hoppy smell, there's not much hop to the taste. Still, a nice tasting beer I'd gladly have again.",2
33,4.5,Maple Nut Brown Ale,American Brown Ale,3,2,2,2,"Bought a six pak of this on a whim. You'd think I'd learn. This beer has a nice deep red color, but I couldn't get any head no matter how I poured it. The aroma was almost candy like. As far as taste, there is a nice nutty taste present, but once again that candy quality that didn't work for me. IMO, more carbonation would liven up the taste and the mouthfeel, which was rather puny. As far as drinkability, don't waste you time on this one.",0
34,8.6,Pumking,Pumpkin Ale,4.5,4,4,4.5,"2009 batch. From the 650 ml. bottle. Sampled on September 29, 2009. There is a handsome, rich orange-amber pour but there is little to no head or retention. The aroma is clearly of pumpkin spices but there is a lot more to it including sweet brown sugar, malts, and maybe even some butternut squash. More creaminess to the mouthfeel but overall it tends to be heavier and appealing. The taste is quite unique. It has this odd mixture of sweet and sour like an Oriental restaurant. There is also a tartiness to the overall experience. This is quite unique and one of a kind. This also has a bit of a punch at 9% ABV. Highly recommended. Maybe another reviewer can get a better handle on what sensations affect the taste buds.",2
35,7.9,Sierra Nevada Belgian Trippel,Tripel,3.5,3,2,2,"A- Very pale and straw colored, and no head at all. S- Smells like a semi fruity malt liquor. Very potent booze smell and very grainy. T- Ehwueh, this is not what I've expected at all. It is not tasty at all to be precise. It truly taste like a malt liquor and tastes nothing like a triple. M- Very little carbination and doesn't feel all that great. D- I wasn't going to pour this out at the bar, but I'm glad I only paid 3 bucks for this, because even then it is not worth it. Personally SN needs to stick to the hoppy beers. This is crap.",0
36,5,Asahi Super Dry,Japanese Rice Lager,3.5,2,3,3,"pours a clear golden color with nice enough fluffy white head. head retention is on the low side leaving a thin lace. medium to large bubbles streaming up through the beer. fairly high carbonation. tough to describe the aroma. pretty light, but similair to most macro lagers. slightly buttery/diacetyl. no noticeable malt/hop presence. taste brings more of the same. very light. again, imagine any macro and thin it out with rice. if that wasnt the whole idea the score wouldnt be nearly as high. mouthfeel is as expected, pretty light. drinkability? well, this isnt quite my cup of tea, uh, beer. probably ok for a rice lager, but i wouldnt be looking for this again.",0
37,4.8,Stoodley Stout,Oatmeal Stout,2,3,2,2.5,"Bottle into Guinness pint glass. Reviewed from notes. A: One finger tan head of poor retention; little cream. Black colour. Looks overcarbonated. Sm: Coffee, alcohol, vanilla, chocolate. Citrus notes are missing from the aroma. T: Chocolate finish. Oats, caramel, vanilla. Poorly balanced and seemingly thrown together. Not bold. Bland flavour. An embarassment to the style. Mf: Lumpy. Too wet and smooth for the style. Dr: Expensive and not particularly good. Avoid.",0

39,10,Hellshire I,American Barleywine,3.5,3,2,1.5,"Thanks Arbi! Muddy amber pour with minimal head formation. Musty, oxidized nose; very nutty with moderate booziness. Somewhat resiny, light caramel. The aroma isn't bad, but the palate is pretty awful. Thin, sharply boozy, with a ton of harsh oak, sticky resiny hop bitterness and nutty oxidation. Caramel and bourbon flavor are pretty faint. Really a godawful finish, a painful combo of excessive bittering hops and harsh wood tannin. Just a bad beer overall.",0
40,4.74,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),American Adjunct Lager,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Had Bottle at the Map Room Bar in Cleveland Poured into Pint Glass a: light straw color fair amount of caronation. Little Head that reduces very quicly s: smells ok, malt not much hops. One of the better smelling macros t: not as watered down as other macros. Nothing that stands out too much in my mind, just a average solid beer that is better than Bud or MGD. m&d: medium bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation. Easy to drink and a great session beer. A good choice over the other BMC crap.",2
41,4.94,Samuel Adams Boston Ale (Stock Ale),American Pale Ale (APA),4,4,4,4,"A - Aggressive pour produces slightly more than finger-thick off-white frothy foam that looks sticky as it clings to the side of the snifter glass. The hue is Pale Amber (SRM 9) in color and clear. The carbonation levels seem to be of low character, which is to style. A thin film is all that is left after a couple of minutes and swirling the beer does result in some spider webbing, though nothing like that of a resinous IPA. S - Biscuit-sweet malt mixes with esters dried fruit and citrus, though citrus notes are mild. Caramel almost seems to come through as well, which would be due to the carmel malted barley used in brewing this beer. American Pale Ales are supposed to have American varieties of hops, though both the aroma and label states that English/German variants (Spalt, East Kent Goldings, and Fuggles) were used. T - Crisp bitterness washes over the palate. Sweetness comes from the caramel and helps to wet what finishes dry. M - Biscuity-sweet light-bodied liquid that have a numbing effect on the palate from the hops. Warming element towards the end of the bottle, though very much a Session Beer! C - This beer, although classified as an APA is referred to by Samuel Adams as a Stock Ale, something they define as a beer that has been cellared in ""stock cellars."" Therefore, a classification of this beer as an American Stock Ale might be a better assessment of this beer. Also, the ABV is now 5.1%, so still a Session Beer, but getting stronger. I remember being disappointed with this beer when I first tried it a few years ago, as I was looking for IPAs almost exclusively at this time and didn't have the knowledge of different beer styles then. Despite this original take on it, I can honestly say that this ""little"" beer comes with a lot of love and forethought and I'm glad that Jim Koch decided to rescue it and this style from the cellar! Prost!",2
42,5.3,Whitewater Wheat Ale,Hefeweizen,3,1.5,1,1,"Hazy orange/tan color, sizable white head. Smell was immediatley recognizable as off. Burnt plastic smell dominated the nose, but there was a little wheat/malt still recognizable above the funk. Taste was absolutely putrid. Rotten apple cider mixed with melted legos is about the only wasy I could describe it. Just awful after appearance. No freshness date was notched on the bottle, but I assume this was still within it's freshness time frame, or, at least, it should not have ben like this. I had to pour out 2/3 of the bottle.",0

Finished silky smooth and chocolatey, a superb dessert beer but be forewarned: if your not into bourbon overtones this may not be your cup of tea.",2
46,5.2,Fat Tire Amber Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Thanks to my friends retrieving a bomber from North Carolina where they were on spring break. Poured into my big glass mug because it was the only thing big enough for the whole bomber. Poured a very lite amber with a little too much head for my taste. The rest of the beer (smell, taste, mouthfeel) was nothing at all spectacular. Finally, this beer was way too expensive for what was at best an average amber. $4.50 a bomber was just dissapointing. I was told by someone I previously trusted that this was an awesome beer. Average at best.",0
47,7.5,Southampton Imperial Baltic Porter,Baltic Porter,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bomber into a pint glass, with a different label than what's pictured. Let's hope that means more distribution of Southampton's brews. Appearance: Almost opaque, with amber hues discerned on the bottom and on the side of the glass slightly in front of some light. Slightly sticky lacing and a head that's pretty large, but even with a vigorous pour dies a bit more quickly than I wanted. Smell: Balance is the word. I've found a new definition for complexity -- so many things so perfectly done. Slightly burnt malt, sweet chocolate, slight molasses, sweet raisins, a hint of coffee, and notes of dark fruit, backed by the faintest of hops. This isn't taking me to new olfactory levels, but everything is near perfect. Taste: Also ridiculously balanced. Somehow the sweetness, and it's pretty damn sweet, is done so well that it's the furthest thing from cloying, which I've never witnessed before. Usually with great Baltic porters, at least in my experience, much of the complexity comes from the insanely toasted nature melded with everything else. Here, though, the balance of sweetnesses, if you will, are very very nice. The raisins, molasses, dark fruit, sweet and slightly toasted malt, and faint hops lingering are all done to near perfection. It won't knock you on your ass with some type of divine religious experience, but what it does it does beyond well. Mouthfeel: Big, rich, full, and creamy. Slight carbonation somehow works; once again it doesn't feel cloying and is welcoming sip after sip. Drinkability: The alcohol's not discerned by me, but it's felt in the best of ways by the end. And it's perfect enough for a nice night cap or after dinner drink, and the bomber is the perfect size. I think I'll be snagging a few bottles of this, especially for the $4.50 price tag. Try it for sure, especially if you're wary of the style, as this is extremely balanced and less insane on the palate, in my opinion, than most Baltic porters that I've had, which makes it perfect for an intro to the style I think.",2
48,5.7,Blue Moon Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,4,3,2,2,"This pumpkin ale pours a nice copper color. The head was very nice and foamy, staying for some time. Unfortunately, the smell was not of pumpkin or any other spice which I could recognize. The taste was sadly bland. Certainly a pumpkin ale which could be skipped.",0
49,5,Cantillon BlÃ¥bÃ¦r Lambik,Lambic - Fruit,5,5,5,5,"Opened this bottle up at my girlfriends medical school graduation party. Shared with a few friends, served around cellar tempature. This was the 4th great sour of the afternoon...we started off with some bullfrog el rojo, next was the veritas 003, followed by some russian river deviation and to end the night a 750ml bottle of 2007 Blabaer. Cap was a bit rusty and smelled like rotting fish...cork was in perfect condition. Upon opening a beautiful stream of white foam with purple tints began to creep its way out of the bottle. The beer pours a deep purple color with a white/pinkish head. Aroma was the most increadable thing i have ever put my nose too. The first thing i notice are the danish blueberries. Its like im smelling fresh blueberries at the local farmers market in the height of their season. This is followed by a subtle funk. Some sour green apples, lemons, cocoa and as it warms a bit it begins to smell exactly like blueberry pancakes. Taste was supurb. A nice blueberry sweetness without being too overpowering, followed by the same blueberry flavor but this time they are very tart. Sour fruits galore in this one, just layers of complexity dancing over your tounge. A nice acetic feel with a bit of wet hay in the mix. The mouthfeel of this lambic is the best i have ever had. Nice smooth carbonation very creamy and goes down better and nicer then anything. The drinkability of this beer is outstanding. Its so flavorful and nice i could drink this all night. This is the most increadable lambic i have had the pleasure of drinking. If you are able to get your hands on a bottle, it will be a wonderful experience.",2

It tries to create a ""best of both worlds"" but the result is catastrophic. A: Clear caramel color with a small head. Small retention and no lacings S: Sweet smell of malts (really smells like Whiskey). Oak. Bit fruity. I could not feel any smoke to a Smoked beer T: Very sweet, first of all. Whiskey malts and that's it. No hops, no bitterness M: Medium body and medium to low carb D: Just avoid it",0

The beer is yellow, perhaps slightly orange, with a finger of white head that leaves some decent lacing on the tulip glass. The aroma is dominated by citrus and hops. Very nice. The flavor follows suit, with notes of tropical fruit, as well as a citrus and floral presence. Subtle notes of pine are present as well. Alcohol presence is well disguised. Malt is secondary to hops, as it should be. A really tasty IPA from an east coast brewery.",2
52,6.8,Best Of Beer Camp: Weizenbock - Beer Camp #37,Weizenbock,4,4,3.5,3.5,"(12oz bottle from Beer Camp mixer pack). Pours a cloudy yellow with a white pillow-top head.

Pale golden colour with fluffy white head that doesnt last very long, some lacing. Grassy sweet aroma with notes of maize/corn and molasses, hints of vomit. Bland flavour, typical industrial adjunct lager, some maize sweetness, low bitterness. I think even Sagres tasted fresher than this one. Not a beer Ill buy again. If I go to Portugal Ill probably stick to vinho verde.",0
54,7,SOS (Save Our Shore),German Pilsener,4,4,4,4,"Slightly hazed golden hue with a fully formed thick billowing white head. Fine speckled lacing left behind as the head dwindles down.

Mouthfeel is light bodied even carbonation going on. Drinkability all day effortless beer drinking experience.",2
55,6.5,High Tide Fresh Hop IPA,American IPA,4,5,4,4.5,"Finally found some wet hopped IPA's. This is my first try at an offering from Port Brewing. Poured from bomber into tulip a nice opaque golden wheat with some bubble action. Head was big and bright and accompanied by sticky lacing. High Tide has a fantastic nose. Big aroma's of grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, orange, and tangerine! This IPA is downright tropical. Flavor was smooth up front with C-Hops hitting sharply giving the tongue a barrage of beautiful citrus notes followed by a nice bitterness and light malt letting the hops do the talking. Mouthfeel was medium, smooth, and refreshingly creamy Drinkability is still pretty good, if you don't go into palate shock first. The ABV is just right, making it hugely session forward.",2
56,4.9,Goldhorn Club,Euro Pale Lager,2,2,1,1.5,"Pours really pale, some foam laying on top and quite some carbonation in there. Dull looking beer. Malts, perhaps some sugar and alcohol.

Really bottom mark on this one.",0
57,7.8,Hades Ale,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Great Divide Hades Ale is golden in color, and has a wonderfully delicate malt nose with hints of spicy bitterness. A beautifully clean malty sweetness followed up, without hesitation, by a crisp spicy hop assertiveness that immediately leads to a wonderfully dry finish that leaves the body of the beer coating the inside of the mouth. An underrated beer from one of the best breweries I know.",2
58,13.5,Unplugged Iced Barleywine,English Barleywine,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Bottle courtesy of jj21, thanks again! Pours a beautiful garnet color, clear and bright with a faint white head. Aromas are kind of dusty, vegetal, with hints of figs, oak, and a bit sugary. Kind of odd smelling, it's certainly interesting. Taste is boozy, but not overly so. Some tartness, (cherries?) dark fruity sweetness, a bit woody, and little bit spicy. Finish is warm, boozy, and with crisp and earthy hop flavors. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, quite smooth, with moderate body. Overall, a unique barleywine, more refined than I expected, I glad I got to try this, very interesting and tasty beer.",2
59,12,Founders Nemesis 2010,American Barleywine,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Appearance -- Pours an incredibly dark brown with chestnut highlights and a slim sudsy beige head. Not much in the way of head retention. Smell -- Juicy grapefruit, tropical fruits, figs, dark fruits, hint of woodsmoke, and plenty of raw and unrefined sugars. Taste -- Bright grapefruit, tropical fruits, figs, dark cherry, prune, molasses, cocoa, char, faint leather and woodsmoke. Ample hop bitterness crescendos toward the finish. Lingering flavors of grapefruit pith, date sugar, and pine reisn. Alcohol is perceptible, but in reasonable proportion for the style. Mouthfeel -- Full-bodied, a bit chewy, with ample fine carbonation. Pretty damn good. Drinkability -- I was really concerned about this beer when I kept hearing people refer to it as a Black IPA. Boy was I relieved. A true American Barleywine with rich dark malt accentuating dark fruit notes. Good stuff, though I can't compare it to 2009. Wish I could've gotten more than just one bottle at the release to try this again in a few years time...",2
60,4.9,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,Vienna Lager,4,3,3.5,2.5,"It's been a while since I've had one, but the other day I was at an airport bar, and this was the best they had to offer, so I gave it another try. Still not impressed. Appearance was pretty good, with a healthy foamy off-white head that left a bit of lace. Light honey color. Aroma was light, a bit corny, not too much hops. Flavor was also pretty light, and unimpressive. Not much balance or character. Very faint light malt, teeny bit of hops, perhaps a bit of sweet corn and honey. Some cinnamon lingers, but a faint acrid note emerges in the finish.",0
61,9.2,Hopsickle Imperial India Pale Ale,American Double / Imperial IPA,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A- Poured with virtually no head; just a diffuse hazy layer and edge lacing over an optically clear dark orange-amber body. Served in tulip which showcased some active carbonation from the sides of the glass. S- Holy Sh*t!! I can smell this from across the room!! Bucketloads of ripe juicyfruit-like hops. There's some crystal malt back in there somewhere, but this is just DOMINATED with those high-alpha citrus and juicyfruit-like hops. Hands-down one of the most amazingly hop-forward beers to ever grace these nostrils! T- Wow. In the mouth, you get a brief glimpse of the pale and crystal malt base, but that is quickly overwhelmed by an INTENSE juicyfruit-like hop flavor. Right into the very dry finish, you have an intense, lingering, citrus pith-like bitterness... lingers like a resin, stripping the enamel from your teeth! This must be the Hop-Head's dream!!! It's like chewing a handful of whole leaf hops! M- Medium body with a moderately soft carbonation and moderate astringency as well. D- The drinkability really suffers from the astringency and one-dimensionality of the hop dominance. It was a sheer pleasure to taste this stuff, but I could not drink a second glass of this in a sitting...",0
62,4,Loft,Belgian Pale Ale,3,2,2,2.5,"Light Orange. Clean, balanced but subtle aroma. The aroma is very spicy, hoppy and fruity. The flavor delivers a very nice citrus and fruit taste from the hops. The added lime leaves add a touch of lime flavor. A nice American wheat ale with a broad range of flavors but this doesnt seem to be in the Belgian mold to me.",0
63,8,Atomium Grand Cru,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,3,4,3,3,"On tap at Maduro. $3 for a massive Chalice. I hear there are 6 grains in here.interesting I immediately notice how fast the head dissipates and that the beer appears to be flat. This is somewhat misleading as there are plenty of minute, champagne like bubbles in there. They are just difficult to see. Unfortunately this will play out later giving the mouthfeel a deceptively flattish and overly light body. Its not flat really just dead feeling. Head is initially two fingers thick but it disperses and shrinks to nothing quickly, no lace, no clinging, nada. The aroma is spicy and confused: fruity esters, bananas, coriander, pepper, powdery yeast, and honey. The flavor is dominated by yeast and booze. Very dry feel from the yeast. Granny smith apples and grapes, peaches and pineapple in the flavor. Muddled. Drinkability is low. I dont find this beer cohesive and remember it being much better in the bottle.",0
64,5,Leroy Stout,Milk / Sweet Stout,3,2.5,3,3,"Sampled at Karakterbier Weekend - Vichte on 11/1/2003... Appearance: dark brown, somewhat translucent for a stout, a thickish tan layer of foam that dissipates rather quickly Aroma: not much going on... some sugary sweetness and a bit of malt, root beer Flavor: very peculiar!... a bland malt flavor and not much roast at all, somewhat saccharine-sweetness (like a diet drink), also an odd component of lychee fruit and a meaty yeastiness Mouthfeel: medium body, light carbonation, sugary Overall Impression: Quite disappointing. How can a brewery that makes the wonderful Hommelbier come up with this? It was a waste of a festival token.",0
65,4.2,Coors Light,Light Lager,1,1,1.5,1,"Poured directly from the keg nozzle into my mouth while I was suspended upside down, supported by two sweaty fraternity brothers counting aloud the number of seconds I was in this precarious position. Apparently this is referred to as 'the kegstand.' As this was a challenging orientation to adequately review the beer, I opted for a foamy pour into a red plastic cup. Due to the opacity of my stemware and poor lighting in this guy's backyard, I can only judge the beer's color by the stains on my shirt from the kegstand and the puddles of beer-vomit on the cement. Likely a horrid Mountain Dew color or a vile urine-like hue. Again, my sense of smell has been dulled by the multiple partygoers' urinating on the fence and the overwhelming scent of Axe Bodyspray--though these odors may be emanating from the beer. Sweaty and tired from bump 'n' grindin' in the living room, this mineral water-like beer proved to be an excellent post-dance hydrator, albeit a metallic one. Kinda like decaf coffee, only more pointless. With beer pong skills as limited as mine, this yellow fizz better be drinkable. It turns out it's not, but the two dozen or so consumed leads me to think otherwise. I look forward to my next brobeer tasting research.",0
66,5,Castle Draught,American Adjunct Lager,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"330ml bottle 5,0% Abv. Tasted with South Africa Lager. The bottle states that Castle Draught was ""brewed to celebrate 115 years of fine South African ingredients"". Appearance: Castle Draught pours a very very light golden colour with a smaller than average white head that dissipates very quickly leaving no lace. Smell: Definitely a stronger nose than the South Africa Lager, but I am still undecided whether that is a good or a bad thing. Although adjuncts still dominate the nose it is far less sweet than expected. The more I smell the more I wish this beer had a much weaker nose. There is a strange and pretty unpleasant almost chemically/metallic smell in the beer, a little bit of cooked vegetable. Taste: The taste pretty much follows on from the smell and is again quite bad. Metallic and adjuncty and not something I want to drink very much more of. Mouthfeel: Very light body and unpleasantly over carbonated. Drinkability: How typical, even a limited 'special' brew from SAB tastes dreadful. Given it's not as bad as Castle Lager but still a beer I will most certainly avoid for the rest of its (thankfully limited) life.",0
67,4.5,Mort Subite Gueuze,Gueuze,2.5,2,2.5,1,"This beer may smell good if you are into Champagne but it is not a good beer smell. Nice color with a this head. The bubbles feel kind of nice on the tongue, but thats the only thing positive I can say about this beer. I would rather drink canned coors light for a week than drink another one of these. This is the first (and LAST) Gueuze I have tried. I sat down on three separate occasions and tried the beer and thought it was horrid each time. I gave the rest to a friend (who likes gueuze) and she thought it was good. So I didn't get a bad batch. I just have no appreciation for this style. No big deal there are plenty more beers to drink out there.",0
68,7.4,Tocobaga Red Ale,American Amber / Red Ale,4,4,4,4,"Poured a slightly hazy reddish brown with a smallish head that dissipated rather uickly to a thin film. Little lace expected but some clings rather tenaciously for a long while. Smell is hoppy with citrus and a faint malt in the background. Taste is along those lines in that hops predominates with a slight citrus note and some malt following in the distance though it is more noticeable in the aftertaste as the hops fades. Nearly full in body, this brew has good carbonation, tangy upfront with a fairly quick fade. A citrusy hop note lingers longest, even surpassing the malt. Some warming occurs late. Another good beer from CCB.",2
69,7,Abbey Belgian Style Ale,Dubbel,3,4,4,2,"I'm not an expert in Belgian Style ale's but this reminds me a lot of a hefeweizen that's been skunked, has WAY too much banana or was otherwise mis-handled. However, if you remove the banana aspects by switching yeasts to a more standard ale yeast I think it would be a great Belgian. It's on the malty side, but with a balanced hop presence. If you like banana you'll love this one, it's just not for me. Won't finish the 6 pack. It's going on my ""i need to offer a beer to someone to be polite but I really dont know if you're worth a good beer so have one of these"" shelves in the beer fridge right next to the Bud Light Wheat.",0
70,5,LongShot Cranberry Wit,Witbier,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Two by two this mixed six goes, into an way over-sized tulip. A hill of stiff eggshell white head, a cloudy honey-colored body. Smell is upfront with sour wheat & general stuffiness. Further down the road, a squeeze of orange, macerated spices(a little too much cinnamon), & something like lemon sugar cookies way in the back. Taste is predominately semi-sweet grain. Whipped up(if dusty) consistency. The coriander & grains of paradise stand out more then the rest of the additives, with the cranberry just barely making an appearance, tarting up the back end, & lingering along with a sharp grassy note. I don't think it's refreshing.",0

Clear copper with a fine creamy eggshell head that lasts and leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Nice resinous hoppy aroma with pine, citrus, herbal and floral hop notes and mildly toasty grain. The malt flavors are smooth and lean like a lager while the hop flavors are more pronounced and complex. Finishes squeaky clean. Medium light bodied with prickly carbonation. This is an amazingly easy to drink, smooth, hoppy and delicious beer. The alcohol is very well hidden for 7.5%. A fine ale indeed and a rare treat in Indy.",2
72,9,Chimay Grande RÃ©serve (Blue),Belgian Strong Dark Ale,5,4,5,5,"This is simply a great beer. It looks nice, smells good and tastes even better. The flavors of dark fruits and a trace of vanilla all blend well within the perfect carbonation. It's taste holds up from first sip to last while the head leaves a nice lacing all the way down. There are a lot of Belgian strong dark ales that successfully emphasize one partucular aspect of the style's taste. Chimay has taken a more balanced approach and they have pulled it off. Only the high ABV, which you don't taste at all, will keep you from having a second. World class.",2
73,8,River Horse Belgian Freeze Belgian Style Winter Ale,Belgian Dark Ale,4,4,3.5,4,"poured a very deep reddish-brown color with modest off-white head that fell to a sparse coating. Smell is of caramel, dark fruits (prunes, figs) and roasted malt. Taste is very sweet and malty with notes of caramel, molasses, raisins, plums present. I can detect a very slight hop bitterness, but only for a moment, then its gone. Alcohol is hidden very well, and its hard to believe this is an 8% beer. Finishes very mild with some soft notes of malt and a a nice fruitiness. Nice and creamy in the mouth. This beer was a pleasure to drink and eay going done, Very nice job from River Horse.",2
74,7.3,Green Flash West Coast I.P.A.,American IPA,4,4.5,3,3.5,"A - Pale cloudy amber in color. Nice thick, rocky off-white head with excellent retention. Plenty of lacing to go around. There is floating debris. I Don't know if that's normal for this beer. S - In the nose you immediately get fresh piney hops and lots of it. Although the hops are very aromatic the malt comes through nicely in the background sweetening it up a bit and leaving a pleasant grassy character. T - Tons of piney hops up front that devastate the palate with bitterness. In a good way. The malts also seem to be playing their part well to balance it all out. M - A tad light bodied. Sort of thin. Carbonation is good though. D/N - Pretty drinkable stuff here. Could easily relax and drink this beer through the night. Although Im not sure the price is right for this one.",2

Brewers get bored of making the same beers everyday. That's why we introduced our line of Limited Edition Beers. What's in this bottle is a unique brew conceived by our crack team of alchemist brewers and produced with painstaking care for the craft beer drinker in you."" My aggro pour created a foamy finger of tawny head with good retention. Color was a slightly hazy reddish-deep amber. Nose was very caramel malt sweet. I waited until 1500 (Local, EST) for my first sip as a toast to Don Younger, R.I.P. It was very malty with a slight sour cherry taste in the mouth. The mouthfeel was rather thin. The finish left me with an impression of cherries, but it was overall muted. I was not terribly impressed.",0

A: The lager has a fortified color, looking more like a hefeweizen than a pale lager. A thin white head never amounted to much. S: The nose is strong, full of alcohol. Sweetness, including apples and creamed corn, is equally strong. The sweetness gradually evolves into a tropical aroma, interesting do doubt. T: Sickly sweet with cinnamon sweetness alongside candied apples. Plenty of booze to go around. Definitely in line with a Euro strong lager, so much so that I'd call it a hangover in a bottle. M: The mouthfeel is sweet and fusel, boozy with lots of fruit. That's not the good kind of fruit though. D: The lager has an alcoholic flavor, like mouthwash without the peppermint. On the upside, it's cheap and provides a near-instant buzz.",0
78,7.2,Rainier Ale,American Malt Liquor,1.5,1,1,1,"Dumped from a twelve ounce can into a standard beer mug, the head rises assertively and has the color and consistency of Cool Whip. The body is straw yellow, translucent. Smell: Opens with a wad of cotton candy that has perhaps been mysteriously lingering in a corpulent person's back pocket for an afternoon -- a musty sweetness. The middle pulls out some wacked weed earthiness, some hints of hop activity, and finishes with a waft of water-logged garbage: dank, sickly sweet. Taste: Cheek-clenching (all four of them) at first, due to an extreme pinch of spoiled powder sugar sweetness, worse than that, it's like taking a shot of Equal straight on the tongue. The middle has an old orange pulp bite, like sucking a wedge that has already been sucked and left to sit for at least an entire day, not that I've ever done that! Towards the end, the alcohol heat takes over, warming the throat to the point where I think ""yes, yes, warmth! take over the taste!"" However, the alcohol heat has the reverse effect of reinforcing the saccharine sweetness and the painfully thin and rusty hop presence, if you can even call it a ""presence."" Mouthfeel: Well, imagine having a cold, a sinus drip...",0
79,8,ÃœberSun (Imperial Summer Wheat Beer),American Pale Wheat Ale,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A- Clear pale amber/orange body with big fluffy white head. Head slowly fades to 1/2 finger with excellent head retention. Not what I expected from this brew but it looks great! S- Smell is a nice combination of a DIPA and a wheat ale. Lots of grapefruit on the nose with an essence of floral hops. A sweet yeasty backbone can be dected too. T- Much like the smell. Lots of grapefruit and floral hops up front with a solid, sweet, bready wheat backbone. The finish is mostly floral hop taste with hints of grapefruit and wheat. Both a slight, crisp bitterness and a sweet yeasty, bready taste linger on the palate. Take a great,well-balanced DIPA and a good wheat ale and combine them and that is what this one tastes like. M- Medium carbonation. Body is both yeasty from the wheat and oily from the hops. Heavy for a wheat ale but still very smooth. Goes down easily. D- Great job by Southren Tier. Alcohol is very well hidden by the big complex taste and mouthfeel. I had this as a reccomendation by the bartender and I took another 22oz bomber home with me to review. Something that I can't wait to revisit. I am looking foreward to trying other offerings from Southren Tier!",2
80,6.2,Hops Infusion,American IPA,3,3,3,2.5,"Smells lemony, with some grapefruit and unsweetend tea. Taste is off for an ipa. More of a hopped up pale ale. It has a lemon [strong] tea bitterness that doesn't quite hit the ipa mark. Not close to what an am. ipa should taste like IMO. Luckily I bought a single 12 oz. so I don't feel too bad.",0
81,7,Slam Dunkel,Weizenbock,4,4,4,4,"A light russet color with plenty of yeast floating and a plethora of carbonation bubbles racing up the sides of the tulip. Thick creamy head of off white/yellow has amazing retention. Milk chocolate, malt balls, banana, hints of clove, spice, yeast, and a wheat ester. Solid beer. Nice creamy mouthfeel that ends in thick carbonation and thick with malt. Great milk chocolate flavors and banana make this like a...you guessed it a chocolate covered banana. Very creamy and nice on the tongue with some alcohol burn on the finish.",2
82,6,11th Anniversary Pale Ale ( Project XI ),American Pale Ale (APA),4,2.5,4,2,"Poured from my growler, perfectly clear light gold, 1/4"" of white foam for a cap , nice lacing Smell was of light malt and a hint of alcohol no hops whatsoever Taste is sweet malty, alcohol is evident in the back end which does have a bit of a chemical taste, I won't go as far as nail polish remover as had been suggested but its unpleasant. Again no hop presence whatsoever. Mouthfeel is nice fits the style well good carbonation and a bright spot here Overall hmmm well I was really excited to see ""Special Anniversary Beer"" on the brewery Facebook, but this is just a major bore. I love the brewery and their presence in the community but please just do some stuff that's exciting and maybe (god forbid) hoppy. Everything seems lately to just be a slight variation of the last and neither being exceptional. Yes I could drink this all day and my palate show no wear, but why must they all be light malt sweetness and miniscule or no hop presence. End rant.",0
83,11,Choklat,American Double / Imperial Stout,4,5,4.5,4.5,"A - black with ruby highlights and a thin brown head. S - Fantastic chocolate aroma. bittersweet chocolate, chocolate milk. T - Creme de cocoa, chocolate milk, Hershey's chocolate syrup, mocha and roasted coffee. M - Smooth and creamy. Full body but smooth and velvety. D - A tasty stout that is pretty much all chocolate but still tasty.",2
84,7.3,Founders Summer Braggot,Braggot,3,4,3,3,"First sip: this is quite good, second sip: this is really good!, third sip: okay, its good but its starting to be too sweet, every sip after that: I can't take any more of this! That was my experience with this braggot. My first braggot and I say that I might not be too much of a fan with the style. The beer looked like dishwater in my glass. The smell was really nice with a natural honey sweetness. The flavor was also all honey with an alcohol kick in the finish. But there was nothing else to offset the honey sweetness. Overly sweet and very cloying in my opinion. I finished the glass but barely. Still, it's good to see Founder's experimenting and trying new beers out.",0
85,5.5,Brewer Patriot Collection - 1790 Root Beer Brew,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3,3.5,2,2,"Part of the 4-pack limited release Patriot Collection, 12 oz bottles. 5.5% ABV. Brewed with Herbs, Spices, Vanilla, Honey, and molasses. Unfiltered. Pours out to a murky amber, with bits of sediment settling to the bottom of the glass. Forms a soapy light yellow head with average retention and sparse lacing. Moderate to mild carbonation. The aroma is very interesting...most striking is the sasparilla/licorice root. My mom used to put sasparilla root into the pan of water which sat on top of our wood furnace to humidify and smell up the place, and this takes me right back to my childhood. You can smell honey and wintergreen above and beyond this. The brew begins with sassafrass, anise and fennel up front and loud, followed by a pungent middle note of licorice, followed by molasses, honey, earth, and caramelized sugars in the finish. Mouthfeel is very syrupy (much syrup-ier than you would expect for a 5.5% ABV brew) with a medium body. This beer has a beginning, middle, and ending like no other, occuring in 3 keenly divided phases. The very mild bitterness comes from the spices, and the licorice adds to a naturally strong and sweet aftertaste. Sour milk before the finish. Drinkability is quite limited. If I were a colonial settler and this is all I had, maybe I'd get used to it. This is an interesting experiment, and it sure tastes authentic compared to what I envision from my readings of colonial ""beer"". Share it with your friends and implant it into your data banks, because you're probably not going to want to drink more than one bottle of this in your lifetime. Fun.",0
86,5.8,Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock,Bock,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Bottle into duvel glass. A: brown, almost no head other than a white ring. S: chocolate milk. Not really a good chocolate beer smell. Not how could I say it. beery enough. T: chocolate milk... too chocolatey. They should have used nibs... M: Not bad not good. D: Doesn't taste like much other than chocolate milk. Meh. Give me a real beer.",0
87,5,Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,5,5,5,5,Arguably todays premier stout and there is no wonder to it's popularity. Dark as midnight this one his the mouth with a take-force flavor but parts the way for a rewarding creamy sweetness that keeps inviting you back for more. A deep coffee and dark chocolate mix. Goes down as smooth as ice cream. I usually find myself having a few in a row before realizing it!,2
88,8,Citra DIPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Growler courtesy of Ultraman9000 - thanks, Martin! Pours a hazy burnt orange color with a two finger off-white head. Head retention is great, as is lacing. The aroma is awesome - tons of tropical fruit with pineapple and mango really shining through. Lighter caramel malt notes underly the tropical fruit hops. The taste is much the same, with lots of tropical fruit hoppiness dominating the flavor profile. The is just enough caramel malt sweetness to add some depth to the taste beyond the hops. The bitterness is pretty high, but the alcohol is very well-hidden. Extremely easy to drink - three of us had no problem finishing the growler in not much time. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation, the finish is pretty dry and bitter with a hint of alcohol warming. Really phenomenal stuff overall. I'd put it right behind the Plinys and pretty close to Dreadnaught and Abrasive in my personal DIPA pecking order.",2
89,4.2,Keystone Light,Light Lager,1.5,1,2,1,"i was looking forward to enjoying a nice delicious beer but unfortunately this was the only beer my room mate had. after taking the first sip i could already tell how bad it was. throughout the entire beer, it tasted like an ass of a cheap beer (example: budweiser and busch). i recommend staying away from this beer at all cost.",0
90,5.4,Great Lakes Holy Moses,Witbier,4.5,3.5,4,4,"On tap in a pint glass at Old Bag of Nails, Hilliard on 6/17/10 A - Light straw-gold. Perfectly clear. White foam holds a thin skim. Very good lacing, though. S - Toasted wheat & grains. Orange peel. Mildly spicy, maybe coriander & clove. The aroma is kind of weak. T - Reasonably crisp, Holy Moses tastes of wheat, grains & vague notion of lemongrass. Prickly hops, though not as zesty as I might expect. Hints of coriander. Light in body with ample carbonation. Finishes crisp; wheat & spices linger. D - Pretty solid overall. It isn't my usual sort of thing but Great Lakes pretty much nailed it for the style.",2
91,6,Hoptober Golden Ale,American Blonde Ale,5,4.5,4,2.5,"A- Darker straw yellow, with golden highlights. A beautiful clear beer, great sparkling color. Huge loose heads erupts to the rim of my glass. Slightly rocky, firm but soapy and bubbly. this is fantastic headed beer. Quite lively, too. Large streams of carbonation flows from the scoring on the Perfect Pint bottom. Solid lacing coats the glass all the way down. Just gorgeous. S- Honey malts and crisp, complex hops from the several types used here, notably the Glacier and Cascade variates. Spicy fruity notes in the aroma, mostly pears and apples. Notes of ganja and even champagne? Huge nose, quite complex with several overlapping layers of aromas. T- Starts off with those wonderful honey malts giving Hoptober a bright entrance upon the palette. But then this brew takes a murky turn into muddled hops; flavors blend without reason and become a overpowering mess of bitter and earthen flavors. Muddled is the best word to describe the middle and finish here, it's just all collapses into itself. No fruitiness, no crispness, just confusing burnt bitterness. What a bummer, I expected great things from the looks and nose. I'm pretty underwhelmed by the taste of this. What happened here? M- Firm body, lightly medium size and with great smoothness. No overbearing carbonation, just a smooth pulling beer with a zippy edge of bubbles, perfect fit for the American Blonde style. D- Not great. Despite gorgeous looks and wonderful and complex smells, the tastes are lost in a smoldering collapsed pile. I hate to slam a local favorite so bad, but I don't like the taste of this.",0
92,9.2,30th Anniversary - Fritz And Ken's Ale,American Double / Imperial Stout,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Aged this in my fridge for 10 months, beginning in March 2010; imbibed last night, January 5, 2011. Posthumous reflection: Appearance - black body with an immense, fluffy light beige head. Inky. The body falls back through the head after sipping, rendering a chocolate colored trail. Smell - Dark, deep roasted malts; citrus hops in the back. Taste - Deep roasted malts; charcoal; alcohol taste is quite reserved. Mouthfeel - Thick and aggressive. Drinkability - Loved the brew and would definitely drink a bunch of it, but 9.2% ABV would require me to take it easy.",2
93,5.4,Great Lakes Holy Moses,Witbier,4,4,4,4,"12 oz. bottle with a best before dating of Jul 12 2005. Pours a hazed pale yellow color with a fluffy white head that dissipates into a thin sheeting of foam. Lightly perfumy in the aroma, my guess is that it is the chamomile. Other typical witbier aromas of unmalted wheat, coriander and orange zest are evident. Lightly sweet, spritzy and a good witbier. The chamomile definitely shows up it the taste with a light tea-like feel. Very flowery. Hop bite is light, but present. A friend brought me back a few beers after touring the brewery and he told me they serve it with an orange wedge in the tasting room. I think it's a mighty fine example of a witbier without it. The addition of chamomile is certainly an interesting twist, as well.",2

95,8,Imperial Pumpkin Ale,Pumpkin Ale,3,2.5,3.5,1,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. 09/25/08. Pours a clear orange amber color with a half finger of beige head. The head quickly disappeared to almost nothing. Aroma is a bit odd. On one whiff I'll get pumpkin, cinnamon, and clove. On another all I get is cherry cough syrup. Taste is similar to the aroma. Sometimes I get light pumpkin, cinnamon, and other spices (lots of clove). But most of the time I get a gross medicinal cough syrup flavor mixed with band-aids. Not pleasant at all. The feel is probably the only good part about this beer. It's well-carbonated and not too heavy. No lingering aftertaste, which is good considering the taste itself isn't good. Drinkability suffers for that reason. The alcohol isn't noticeable. I really can't recommend this. Other reviews seem pretty favorable so maybe I got a bad bottle. But the rest of this one is going down the drain...",0
96,10,Old Blarney Barleywine,American Barleywine,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Dark, deep amber with a big and sticky tan head. Roasted malt, dark fruits, piney hops and sweet candy sugar mix with alcohol aromas. Full, round sweet malt with a balance of piney hop and bitter spiciness. Raisen, prune flavors underneath and a warming shot of alcohol. Smooth, almost creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this one. Warming and cozy barleywine. A sipper. All around solid and more balanced than many. Very nice.",2
97,3.7,Anchor Pilsener,German Pilsener,2,2,2.5,2,"This one was brewed and canned by Cambodian Brewery Ltd, under license form Asia Pacific Breweries. Silver can with a red front, and two crossed anchors. Pale yellow gold colour, with a small amount of head. Dissipates to an almost unnoticeable ring. No lacing. Slightly malty nose, but no touch of hops. Also a hint of a banana ester. Not particularly appealing, nor is it really suitable for a pilsener. Taste is more noticeably bitter, but has an unpleasant bubblegum and diacetyl flavour. Finishes very water, making me wonder if I actually took a sip at all. Mouthfeel weak, but fitting, I guess... Yeah, you can slug this down with the other Cambodian swill. Not worth the effort to open the can. As an aside, Cambodia has the unfortunate ambiguity of having two very similarly named beers widely available: Angkor and Anchor. Given that neither of these beers are good enough to warrant creating the confusion that inevitably occurs when you order one and receive the other, you wonder why they bother...",0
98,5.25,Samuel Adams Pale Ale,English Pale Ale,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear, amber body with a two finger, offwhite head that demonstrates good retention and laces the glass with considerable patching. Aroma features pale malt, a hint of caramel, and a restrained, but evident, English style, herbal/floral hops note. Mouthfeel is light bodied, and has medium carbonation. Very mild hops bite on the tongue. Taste is of a well balanced, British style, pale ale, similar to Bass. A sweet malt backbone is balanced by a subdued, but pleasant, hops presence. Don't expect an American style, IPA here. This is nowhere close to a hoppy, SNPA, but compares favorably to a Bass Pale Ale. Finish is clean, and slightly dry. Drinkability is very good. A very nice alternative if you're faced with a limited selection in a store or restaurant.",2
99,4.2,Coors Light,Light Lager,1,1.5,1.5,1,"Pouring it out of the ""Vented Wide Mouth Can"" into an appropriate container: a bright-red beerpong cup, I timed how long it would take to have the head leave. It's less than a minute and couldn't be more than an eight of an inch thick. Smell was of aluminum and steel, sugar and a modicum of hops. Taste was if someone at Stone Brewery or Brewery Ommegang were to rinse the brewkettles out and sell the rinsewater as Coors Light. Water with a bit of sugar-sweet. But mainly water. Mouthfeel was of water, but a little slick at the end. Drinkability is why people use this for beerpong. That's what it should only be used for.",0
