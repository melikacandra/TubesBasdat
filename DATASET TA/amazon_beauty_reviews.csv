But I have such straight hair without any real body so the beachy look just isn't a good look for me, unlike in my younger years when I loosely permed my hair and my hair would look great at the beach even after swimming in the ocean half the day. I tried twisting my hair and styling per the instructions for straight hair, and it just didn't look good at all. My hair ended up looking stringy, sloppy and unstyled. To be fair, I don't think any spray on product could give me that awesome beachy look due to my straight hair type.<br /><br />If I spray this Tresemme on my damp hair and blow dry as usual with a round brush, it does adds a little lift, volume and texture to my straight hair. But it's just one more product to add to the routine as it doesn't substitute for my hair gel or any other product, and I still need to finish with my Zero Weight Gel for shaping, hair separation and taming flyaway hairs. This Tresemme may work great for curly or wavy hair, but for my straight hair it doesn't create an attractive beachy look. While it does work okay as a styling aid, it's just one more product to add to my routine that I can live without. It's just okay.",31/08/2015

I've tried tons of products promising new skin and heels so fancy, you'll never want to wear shoes, again. Nothing worked. My heels are probably typical of most women who go to the gym, wear sandals all summer, and wear those &#34;cute&#34; shoes that kill us. I use the Pedi Egg and various &#34;sanders&#34; from Beauty Brands each time I shower. Though the simple things like homemade foot scrubs, sanding, and lotion can help, nothing, and I mean nothing, worked like this product! After weeks and weeks of researching and humming and hawing, it went on sale and I bought it. Here's my tip to success: Soak feet. Take a nice long bath. I used bubbles, made myself some nice tea, brought in my iPad and watched about 40 minutes of TV to pass the time. (I hate baths. This part was the hardest for me.) Then I dried my feet a little, and while still prune toed from the bath, slipped the pre-gel booties on and put on a pair of my husband's socks over them to help keep them in place. I left mine on for 90 mins (suggested by a blogger) and then rinsed them off. My feet had a sheen to them and smelled nice but that was it. A watched foot does not peel. Day 2: Soaked just my feet in a foot bath for 30 mins. Nothing exciting but my feet felt relaxed from the hot water. Day 3: Whoa. My big toe, previously callused, peeled a little. I couldn't help but pick a tiny bit to reveal all this new skin under what felt like a giant mound of dead skin. Day 4: The sides of my feet started to peel some along with my heels a tiny bit. I continued to soak daily from 20-45 mins. I also have been wearing socks and sneakers all week. I've also sent out texts to multiple friends who were disgusted. Day 5: The magic starts to happen! More peeling...even around my toenails where I thought nothing bad was happening. Apparently, dry dead skin resided there, too. Right now I'm on Day 8: The majority of the peeling is over. I have been taking daily foot soaks/baths, using a washcloth to rub off dead skin during the foot bath, and today I peeled a little by hand because I couldn't help myself. Not much more peeling is happening. There's a few bits here and there but as I lay in bed, rubbing my once sandpaper feeling feet together, images of silk feet pop in my head. They feel so nice and the cracks and calluses are gone! I'll probably shed another day or two and be done with it. I'll buy this product, again, and will recommend this over any expensive pedicure any woman dare try (and I've even done the pedi where they razor cut your skin off your heels!). This is worth it. I have felt no pain. My feet look amazing. There's really nothing to it besides trying to hide your feet during the molting. If you're diabetic or have allergic reactions to any of the fruit acids or alcohol, it's not recommended. If you &#34;help the peeling&#34; along, you could hurt yourself. Those are just some warnings on the package it comes in.

The lotion is in a very secure glass jar that feels like both very high quality and durable. Both products look very nice on my counter.<br /><br />The soap smells very wonderful.

Some of the lighter colors (i.e., gold) don't show up super well on pale skin, especially if you are also wearing a shimmery eyeshadow.  So keep that in mind.  (The gold would look awesome on darker skin without shadow, and I can make it work without shadow on my pale skin, as well.)<br /><br />These last all day under any one (or more) of the following conditions:<br /><br />(1) If you don't have oily eyelids<br />(2) If you use a setting powder or finishing powder (like the translucent one from e.l.f.)<br />(3) If you wear them over primer and powder eyeshadow<br /><br />If you have oily eyelids and don't do #2 or #3 above, this will migrate (trust me -- been there, done that).<br /><br />I wear contact lenses and have somewhat sensitive eyes but these do not give me any trouble, which is great.

The consistency and finish is different. The most noticeable thing about the finish here is that it's patchy. I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker, especially because at a brick-and-mortar store, I bought this for $3.99, sight unseen (no tester). It IS matte, it dries somewhat quickly, but ends up being quite thick on. The color is very chic, although it's a little different than the photo, I'd say less muted/less burgundy. It's a good buy. Just not the highest quality, because of the patchiness.<br /><br />[edit] I was writing this review for the color Backstage, but I see the colors are kind of all mashed into one listing.<br /><br />The color Stunner is another one I have -- and the only thing I have to say about is that if you think it's &#34;too purple,&#34; go ahead and spend five bucks on it.

Even with black-out curtains I have trouble falling asleep. One thing I've noticed that really helps are sleeping masks. With that being said, I've tried quite a few and I haven't found one that completely blocked out the light or was comfortable to wear. This mask is different, and possibly one of the best I've ever worn to bed. I purchased a homemade one on Etsy that is still my favorite (because I like the owl print on it), but this one is half the price and just as good in quality- which is why I'm rating it 5 stars.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this sleeping mask was the thickness. No light is going to get through this mask! It seems a little bulky at first- especially if you're used to the thin silk masks that are commonly sold. With that being said, once you get used to wearing something like this you'll notice a significant difference in the amount of light that gets through. It truly does create a blacked out environment that is really nice.<br /><br />The mask fit my head perfectly. I have pretty average head size, so I think I can fairly say that this mask can be adjusted to fit anyone. The mask can be adjusted with little sliding adjusters and then has a clasp in the back that secures the mask around your head. The company boasts that the clasp won't snag in hair- and I have very snaggly fine hair. So far it hasn't gotten tangled in my hair, although sometimes I do accidently clasp a few strands of hair into the clip and it pulls them out when I roll around. I just put my hair in a low pony tail to avoid that problem.<br /><br />One thing that I really love about this mask is that it's contoured to fit around the bridge of your nose. Most sleeping masks don't adequate fit around your nose so have small gaps where light can get through. That is not the case with this mask. Because it fits snug around all of the curves of your face- literally no light gets through. That is something that my Etsy eye mask did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask. I have a Jewish nose (a big nose) and it fits well over it.<br /><br />Overall, I do really like this mask. The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that's my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it's a great product. Very quality sewn and made with good materials. It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face. I'd definitely recommend this mask for anyone looking for a sleep aid. It'd make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!k did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.
